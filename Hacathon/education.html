Explore your interest as you have lots of subjects in options to select. Don't select options depending on which subject you like or which subject is easy. Because there may be 1 subject you like but other subjects in that field may be difficult for you, then it would be wrong choice.<br>
Select the field which you don't feel bored even after studying so much. That is, think of your final goal. Don't depend on results/Marks. Percentage is not the only factor, there are many other things like interest and ability to study. Decide now itself what you want to study after 12th and what you need to study to achieve that goal.<br>
